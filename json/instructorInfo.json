Over the past year, I have reached elimination rounds at many tournaments such as Bethel Park, and went undefeated at Harvard prelims to reach triples. My partner and I also qualified to the National Tournament for Policy debate. Aside from my debate experience, me and a few others are working on a non-profit that can give back to underprivileged communities by teaching debate to children who are unfortunate enough to not have those types of programs. I also play the guitar, and am interested in pursuing a law related career. Im volunteering to teach, because when I was a freshman - I had great coaches such as Elijah Duckworth and Akshana Dassanaike, who really made me and a few other kids stand out from the rest on the circuit. Thus, I don't want other novices to have to miss out on a whole experience that could make them a vital member to our speech and debate, whereas I can help students find their hidden potential for argumentation."
